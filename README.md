# **Cyclistic-users-analysis**

## **Introduction**
This analysis is based on the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study, which is part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certification on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)capstone project.

Cyclistic is a fictitious Chicago-based bike-sharing company. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Our Business Task
Analyze and identify the variations in bike usage patterns between annual members and casual riders of Cyclistic, in order to gain insights into their distinct behaviors and preferences.

The data used for this analysis is sourced from the [divvy-tripdata S3 bucket](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and/or the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonukolga/cyclistic-bike-share-data-12-months). The data is made available under a specific license provided by [Motivate International Inc](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) for purposes of analysis.

## **This project is organized into several steps:**

 - Creating a public dataset on Kaggle with monthly updates of available data for the past 12 months using Python 3. You can explore the [code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/antonukolga/cyclistic-bike-share-data) and [results](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonukolga/cyclistic-bike-share-data-12-months) on Kaggle. This step is driven by the limitations of free usage of BigQuery, which restricts file size to 100MB. The goal is to create an accessible and up-to-date dataset for students.

 - Conducting quality research and data analysis using R and ggplot2. You can review the code and documented process on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/antonukolga/are-users-cyclistic-different). This step corresponds to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study, which is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) capstone project.

 - Performing data reduction using stratified sampling to preserve the data distribution as accurately as possible. This step aims to address limitations imposed by using Tableau Public, which restricts data file size to 1GB. The result is generating an HTML report with statistical analysis and new dataset based on Python 3.

 - Visualizing the data in Tableau and presenting key analysis findings. This step aligns with the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study, which is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification on Coursera capstone project. It's important to note that the data used for visualization has undergone stratified sampling, so the visualizations may not accurately represent the real-world scenario. The visualization is created for educational and demonstrative purposes.
